Flex Trivia by Garri Kats. A fun, intuitive, single-player trivia game built on the technologies learned in the first level of the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp. Test your wit though 30 levels of facts pulled from the Open Trivia Database. Difficult increases from easy in levels 1-10, medium in levels 11-20 and hard in levels 21-30. Once you see your final score, hit 'play again' for another round!
